# 🎬 IMDb Box Office Revenue Prediction - Mini Project

## **Project Overview**  
This mini project explores the use of **regression models** to predict the **box office revenue** of movies based on various features extracted from the **IMDb dataset**. The dataset includes essential information such as **budget**, **runtime**, **genre**, and **release date**. By applying different regression algorithms, this project aims to forecast a movie's financial success, providing valuable insights for film studios.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to predict a movie's **box office revenue** based on various features such as:
- **Budget**
- **Runtime**
- **Genre**
- **Release Year**
- **Popularity**
- **Size of Cast**
- **Number of Spoken Languages**
- **Number of Production Companies**

---

## 📊 **Regression Models Used**  
The project employs several **regression models** to analyze and predict movie revenues:
- **Linear Regression**  
- **K-Neighbors Regression**  
- **Gradient Boosting Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Regression**  
- **XGB Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regression**  

---

## 📈 **Model Performance Metrics**  
Each model is evaluated using the following performance metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-squared (R²)**

### **Results**  
- **Linear Regression**: R² = 0.48  
- **Random Forest Regression**: R² = 0.50  

Both models show reasonable performance in predicting box office revenue, with Random Forest slightly outperforming Linear Regression.
